### My Xcode File Templates

To install just clone the repo and then run `./install.sh` from the repo's root directory. They should then be available from Xcode's new file menu under iOS.

To make these file templates, I used these for reference and inspiration:

https://github.com/reidmain/Xcode-6-File-Templates

https://github.com/royclarkson/xcode-templates

The template files I used as a base were grabbed from `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/File Templates/Source/Cocoa Touch Class.xctemplate` and/or `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/File Templates/Source/Cocoa Class.xctemplate`
